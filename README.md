# HoneyPotSentinel
This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a basic SOC in Azure, starting from scratch using a free Azure subscription. I went through the process of creating a virtual machine (VM) and turning it into a honeypot, intentionally opening it to the internet to capture real-world attack attempts. The security logs generated by the honeypot are then forwarded to a central repository for analysis. Finally, I integrate Microsoft Sentinel, Azure's powerful security information and event management (SIEM) service, to analyze the attack data, identify potential threats, and gain valuable experience in threat detection and incident response.
